# findings : US branded cars focus more on horsepower than mpg. And there is a correlation between
# hp and mpg. When the hp is high, mpg is low and the mpg increases when hp decreases.
# Also, non US branded cars focus more on mpg than hp. They focus more on average than power.

# findings 2 : When compared mpg with cylinders, US branded cars focus more on cylinders than mpg. The
# median OF mpg for US branded cars is around 17-18 with the median of the cylinders move towards
# the upper quartile for US branded cars.

# European cars focuses both on power as well as mileage where the median of mpg is around 26 and
# cylinders is between 5 - 6.
# The Japanese cars are more economical as it focuses more on mpg than cylinders. The Median of mpg
#for the japanese cars is around 32 and the no of cylinders is between 4-5

# finding 3 : When compared mpg with the weightlbs which is again average vs power, US branded cars
# look for less mpg and morw weight. Again there is a direct correlation between mpg and weightlbs
# As weightlbs increases, mpg decreases. Japanese cars are again focussing more on MPG and less
# on weighlbs. European cars are in between US and Japanese cars with mid level mpg and weightlbs

# finding 4 : From the 4th finding we can observe that the market is more US branded cars dominant.
# but interestingly in the year 1981 and 1982, the japanese cars dominated the market where there
# were no European cars produced in 1982
# Undoubdtly, US cars ruled the market from 1970 to 1983. There was a tough competition between European
# and the Japanese cars
